To Predict goto Part2.ipynb
Final Codes are in Part1 and Part2.ipynb

Regression Model.ipynb
Classification Model.ipynb
These 2 Files are used to make Models

Other Files are used for Research and Testing Purposes


How is it working ?
The Regression Model is Used to predict some ratios which will be used by Classification Model
The Classification Model will then Use those Ratios to Further Classify the Attack Type
